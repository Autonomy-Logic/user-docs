# 1.1 Introduction to Autonomy Edge

## What is Autonomy Edge?

Autonomy Edge is a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed for industrial automation professionals. It provides a comprehensive solution that combines modern project management capabilities with a powerful browser-based IEC 61131-3 programming environment, enabling you to develop, manage, and deploy PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programs entirely from your web browser.

## Platform Overview

The Autonomy Edge platform brings together two essential components for industrial automation development:

### Cloud-Based Project Management

Autonomy Edge provides a centralized hub for managing your automation projects with features including:

- **Project Organization**: Create, organize, and manage multiple PLC projects with folder-based hierarchies
- **Collaboration**: Share projects publicly or keep them private, clone projects from other users, and collaborate with team members
- **Version Control**: Track project changes and maintain a history of your work
- **Activity Feed**: Stay updated with recent project activities and changes across the platform
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find projects and users across the platform

### Browser-Based IEC 61131-3 IDE

At the heart of Autonomy Edge is a sophisticated Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that runs entirely in your web browser. The IDE is based on OpenPLC and supports the full suite of IEC 61131-3 programming languages:

- **Structured Text (ST)**: High-level text-based programming with Pascal-like syntax
- **Ladder Diagram (LD)**: Traditional relay logic programming with graphical representation
- **Function Block Diagram (FBD)**: Visual programming using interconnected function blocks
- **Instruction List (IL)**: Low-level assembly-like programming language
- **Sequential Function Chart (SFC)**: State machine programming for sequential processes

The IDE also extends beyond standard IEC 61131-3 with support for:

- **Python Function Blocks**: Create custom function blocks using Python with full Language Server Protocol (LSP) support
- **C++ Function Blocks**: Develop high-performance function blocks in C++ with code completion

## Key Capabilities

### Offline-First Development

The Autonomy Edge IDE is built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), which means you can continue working on your projects even when you're offline. Your work is automatically synchronized when you reconnect to the internet.

### Orchestrator and Device Management

Beyond project development, Autonomy Edge provides infrastructure management capabilities:

- **Orchestrators**: Manage runtime environments that coordinate multiple PLC devices
- **Virtual PLC Devices (vPLC)**: Configure and deploy virtual PLC instances for program execution
- **Device Monitoring**: Track device status, resource usage, and connectivity

### Modern Development Experience

The platform provides a modern development experience with features you'd expect from contemporary IDEs:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded syntax for all supported languages
- **Code Completion**: Intelligent autocomplete for variables, function blocks, and data types
- **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate feedback on syntax errors and type mismatches
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Intuitive graphical programming with drag-and-drop components
- **Multi-Language Support**: Seamlessly work with different programming languages in the same project

## Who Should Use Autonomy Edge?

Autonomy Edge is designed for:

- **Control Engineers**: Professionals developing industrial automation and control systems
- **PLC Programmers**: Engineers familiar with IEC 61131-3 programming who want a modern, cloud-based development environment
- **Automation System Integrators**: Teams deploying and managing distributed automation systems
- **Students and Educators**: Individuals learning industrial automation programming
- **Industrial IoT Developers**: Engineers building edge computing solutions for industrial applications
