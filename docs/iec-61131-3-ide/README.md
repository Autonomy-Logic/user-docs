# IEC 61131-3 Programming IDE

The Autonomy Edge platform includes a powerful browser-based IEC 61131-3 programming IDE that allows you to create, edit, and manage PLC programs directly from your web browser. This integrated development environment provides all the tools you need to develop industrial automation applications using the five standard IEC 61131-3 programming languages, as well as custom languages like Python and C++.

## What is IEC 61131-3?

IEC 61131-3 is the international standard for programmable logic controller (PLC) programming languages. It defines five programming languages that are widely used in industrial automation:

- **Structured Text (ST)**: A high-level, text-based language similar to Pascal
- **Ladder Diagram (LD)**: A graphical language that resembles electrical relay logic
- **Function Block Diagram (FBD)**: A graphical language using interconnected function blocks
- **Instruction List (IL)**: A low-level, assembly-like text language
- **Sequential Function Chart (SFC)**: A graphical language for sequential control

## Key Features of the IDE

The Autonomy Edge IDE provides a comprehensive development environment with the following features:

### Professional Development Tools
- **Multi-language Support**: Write code in any of the five IEC 61131-3 languages, plus Python and C++ for custom function blocks
- **Intelligent Code Editor**: Syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection
- **Graphical Editors**: Visual programming tools for Ladder Diagram, Function Block Diagram, and Sequential Function Chart
- **Project Explorer**: Hierarchical view of all project components including POUs, data types, and configuration

### Debugging and Testing
- **Real-time Console**: Monitor runtime logs and system messages
- **Variable Debugging**: Watch and modify variable values during execution
- **Breakpoints and Step Execution**: Debug your code line by line (coming soon)

### Project Organization
- **Program Organization Units (POUs)**: Organize your code into reusable Programs, Function Blocks, and Functions
- **Custom Data Types**: Define structures, arrays, and enumerations for complex data handling
- **Task Configuration**: Configure cyclic and interrupt-driven tasks for real-time control
- **Hardware Configuration**: Map your program to physical I/O and communication interfaces

### Cloud Integration
- **Browser-Based**: Access your development environment from anywhere with an internet connection
- **Version Control**: All projects are automatically saved and versioned in the cloud
- **Collaboration**: Share projects with team members and work together
- **Deployment**: Deploy your programs directly to virtual PLC devices or edge hardware
