# Runtime Overview

OpenPLC Runtime v4 is a headless PLC runtime designed for modern industrial automation. This page provides an overview of its architecture and key features.

## Architecture

Runtime v4 uses a modular architecture with the following components:

### Core Engine

The core engine handles:

- PLC program execution with deterministic scan cycles
- Memory management for I/O and internal variables
- Task scheduling using SCHED_FIFO for real-time priority

### REST API

All interaction with the runtime is through a REST API:

- HTTPS-only communication on port 8443
- JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication
- Endpoints for program upload, control, and monitoring

### Plugin System

The runtime supports plugins for extending functionality:

- **Python Plugins**: Easy-to-develop plugins for protocols and I/O
- **C/C++ Plugins**: High-performance plugins for demanding applications
- Plugins are configured via JSON files generated by the editor

### WebSocket Debug Interface

Real-time debugging capabilities:

- Live variable monitoring
- Variable forcing for testing
- Secure WebSocket connection

## Key Features

### Real-time Execution

The runtime uses Linux SCHED_FIFO scheduling to achieve deterministic scan cycle times. This ensures reliable control even under system load.

### Security

- All communication encrypted via HTTPS
- JWT authentication for API access
- No default passwords - first user must be created

### Extensibility

The plugin system allows adding:

- Communication protocols (Modbus, OPC-UA, etc.)
- Hardware I/O drivers
- Custom functionality

### Headless Operation

Unlike v3, Runtime v4 has no web interface. All configuration is done through:

- The OpenPLC Editor (desktop or web)
- Direct REST API calls
- JSON configuration files

## Comparison with Runtime v3

| Feature | Runtime v4 | Runtime v3 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Web Interface | No | Yes |
| API | REST + JWT | HTTP |
| Protocols | Plugin-based | Built-in |
| Configuration | JSON files | Database |
| Security | HTTPS + JWT | Basic auth |
| Port | 8443 | 8080 |

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- Linux operating system (kernel 4.x or later)
- 512 MB RAM
- 100 MB disk space
- Network connectivity (for remote access)

### Recommended

- Linux with real-time kernel patches
- 1 GB RAM or more
- SSD storage for faster program loading
- Dedicated network interface for industrial protocols
