# Projects

Learn how to create, manage, and organize projects in Autonomy Logic.

## What is a Project?

A project is a container for organizing your automation applications, configurations, and resources. Projects help you:

- Organize related automation tasks
- Manage permissions and access control
- Track changes and versions
- Deploy applications to devices

## Creating a Project

### Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the Projects page
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Enter project details
4. Configure initial settings
5. Click "Create"

### Using the API

Create projects programmatically using the API:

```bash
# API example will be added here
```

## Project Structure

Each project contains:

- **Applications** - Your automation programs
- **Configurations** - Project-specific settings
- **Resources** - Shared libraries and assets
- **Devices** - Connected hardware devices

## Managing Projects

### Editing Project Settings

Modify project settings including name, description, and configuration.

### Project Permissions

Control who can view, edit, and deploy your projects.

### Archiving Projects

Archive projects that are no longer active but need to be retained.

## Project Workflows

### Development Workflow

1. Create or open a project
2. Develop your automation logic
3. Test in development environment
4. Deploy to staging
5. Promote to production

### Collaboration

Multiple users can collaborate on projects with role-based access control.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive project names
- Organize projects by function or location
- Regularly backup project configurations
- Document project-specific requirements
- Use version control for tracking changes

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Orchestrators](orchestrators.md)
- Manage [Devices](devices.md) in your projects
- Review [API Endpoints](../api-reference/endpoints.md) for automation
