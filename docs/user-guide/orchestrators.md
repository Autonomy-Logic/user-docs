# Orchestrators

Orchestrators coordinate and manage automation workflows across multiple devices and systems.

## What is an Orchestrator?

An orchestrator is a component that:

- Coordinates multiple automation tasks
- Manages device communication
- Handles workflow execution
- Monitors system health
- Provides centralized control

## Orchestrator Types

### Local Orchestrator

Runs on a single device or edge node for local automation control.

### Cloud Orchestrator

Centralized orchestration from the cloud for distributed systems.

### Hybrid Orchestrator

Combines local and cloud orchestration for optimal performance and reliability.

## Setting Up an Orchestrator

### Prerequisites

- Active project
- Configured devices
- Network connectivity
- Appropriate permissions

### Configuration Steps

1. Create a new orchestrator instance
2. Configure connection settings
3. Assign devices to the orchestrator
4. Define workflows and rules
5. Test and validate

## Orchestrator Features

### Workflow Management

Define and execute complex automation workflows.

### Device Coordination

Coordinate actions across multiple devices in real-time.

### Event Handling

Respond to events and triggers from connected devices.

### Monitoring and Alerts

Monitor orchestrator health and receive alerts for issues.

## Managing Orchestrators

### Starting and Stopping

Control orchestrator lifecycle through the web interface or API.

### Updating Configuration

Modify orchestrator settings without interrupting operations.

### Scaling

Scale orchestrators horizontally for increased capacity.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Connection failures
- Performance degradation
- Synchronization problems
- Resource constraints

### Diagnostics

Use built-in diagnostic tools to identify and resolve issues.

## Best Practices

- Monitor orchestrator performance regularly
- Implement redundancy for critical workflows
- Use appropriate orchestrator type for your use case
- Keep orchestrator software updated
- Document workflow logic and dependencies

## Next Steps

- Connect and manage [Devices](devices.md)
- Review [Architecture](../advanced/architecture.md) documentation
- Explore [API Endpoints](../api-reference/endpoints.md) for automation
