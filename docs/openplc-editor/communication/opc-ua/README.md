# OPC-UA Communication

OPC-UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation. It provides a secure, reliable, and platform-independent framework for data exchange.

> **Note**: OPC-UA support in OpenPLC is currently under development. This documentation will be updated as the feature becomes available.

## Overview

OPC-UA offers several advantages over traditional protocols:

- **Security**: Built-in encryption and authentication
- **Platform Independence**: Works across different operating systems and hardware
- **Information Modeling**: Rich data modeling capabilities
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small devices to enterprise systems

## Coming Soon

The following OPC-UA features are planned for OpenPLC:

- OPC-UA Server functionality
- OPC-UA Client functionality
- Integration with the OpenPLC Editor for configuration

Check back for updates as this feature is developed.
