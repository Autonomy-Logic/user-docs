# Microcontrollers

OpenPLC Editor (desktop version) supports programming microcontroller boards directly, allowing you to create standalone PLC devices using affordable hardware like Arduino, ESP32, and other compatible boards.

> **Note**: Microcontroller programming is only available in the desktop version of OpenPLC Editor. The web editor (Autonomy Edge) does not support this feature.

## Overview

With microcontroller support, you can:

- Write PLC programs using IEC 61131-3 languages
- Compile programs directly for microcontroller targets
- Upload programs via USB to the target board
- Create standalone automation controllers

## Supported Board Families

OpenPLC Editor supports a wide variety of microcontroller boards:

- **Arduino**: Uno, Mega, Due, Nano, Leonardo, and more
- **ESP32/ESP8266**: WiFi-enabled boards for IoT applications
- **STM32**: High-performance ARM Cortex-M boards
- **Controllino**: Industrial Arduino-compatible PLCs
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: RP2040-based boards

## Getting Started

1. Install OpenPLC Editor desktop application
2. Create a new project or open an existing one
3. Configure the target board in Hardware Configuration
4. Write your PLC program
5. Connect your board via USB
6. Compile and upload the program
